# 🎼 Market Sonifier

Market Sonifier is a real-time market data **sonification instrument**.  
It converts live market data from **Kraken (crypto)** and **Alpaca (stocks)** into **MIDI music**, allowing you to "hear" the market as it moves.

This project serves as both a research tool and the core of a future market performance art system.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time price data from **Kraken** and **Alpaca** APIs
- Maps prices, volume, RSI trends to musical notes, chords, and percussion hits
- Modular class-based Python design

## 🎯 Concept

Each market becomes a unique voice:
- **Crypto assets (BTC, ETH)** → synth bass & melody lines  
- **Stocks (AAPL, MSFT)** → harmony or arpeggios  
- **Volume spikes** → percussion hits  
- **RSI** controls tempo / mood shifts  

You can literally **hear market volatility and trends** as an evolving musical performance.
